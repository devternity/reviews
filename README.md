# reviews

This repository contains a set of best practices for reviewing the content.

# do's

* speakers must engage with the audience at least few times during the speech
* speakers must answer questions (including those asked by moderators) by looking at the audience
* all slides must be relevant to the audience and challenged with the following questions:

1) why you are telling / showing this? 
2) why is this important to the audience? (`ok, it's a nice slide and story. So what?`)
3) is there a better way to convey the same message?

* speakers must cut down all the words said to the bare minimum and leave only the essentials. Once done, repeat.
* speakers must never expect audience to read the slides (except schemes, algorithms, where speaker is explaining it step by step)
* speakers must design minimalistic slides. An ideal slide has a single buzzword or a short sentence. All supporting information should be spoken.

# dont's 

* speakers must not read from the transcript
